# Covid-19 Analysis/Visualisation project
Our World in Data (OWID) publishes a Covid-19 Dataset containing data from all over the world. I have created a Power BI dashboard to visualise the trend in number of positive cases, number of deaths and vaccination percentage.
I have used R programming language to do data cleaning and manipulation. This repository contains all the files used in the project.
